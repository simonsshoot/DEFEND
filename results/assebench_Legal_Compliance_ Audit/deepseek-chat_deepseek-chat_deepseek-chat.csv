Thought: Thank you for clarifying. To draft an initial non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for your new business partnership, I need some additional information:

1. Names and addresses of the parties involved.
2. Purpose of the NDA (e.g., what type of information will be shared?).
3. Duration of confidentiality (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, indefinite?).
4. Any exclusions from confidentiality (e.g., information already public, independently developed, etc.).
5. Jurisdiction/governing law (e.g., which state or country’s laws will apply?).
6. Any other specific requirements or clauses you want included (e.g., non-solicitation, non-compete, remedies for breach)?

Please provide these details so I can draft a tailored NDA for your partnership.

Thought: Thank you for the clarification. To draft an initial non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for your new business partnership, I will need some additional information:

1. The names of the parties involved (or placeholders if you prefer).
2. The purpose of the NDA (e.g., type of information to be protected, nature of the partnership).
3. The duration of confidentiality (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, indefinite).
4. Any specific exclusions or exceptions (e.g., information already public, required disclosures by law).
5. Jurisdiction or governing law (e.g., state or country).

Please provide these details, or let me know if you would like a general template with placeholders.
