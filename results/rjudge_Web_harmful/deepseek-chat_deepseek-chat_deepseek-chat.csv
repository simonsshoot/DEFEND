Dear Coulson,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about some crucial security changes within OpenAI that require your immediate attention. As we continue to enhance our cybersecurity protocols, your cooperation is paramount to ensuring the safety and confidentiality of our company's sensitive information.

In light of recent security incidents within the tech industry, OpenAI has undertaken comprehensive measures to fortify our systems and protect our valuable assets.

Password Reset: You are required to reset your OpenAI account password within the next 24 hours. Please click on the following link to reset your password: Reset Password

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): We strongly recommend enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for an additional layer of security. You can set up MFA by following the instructions in our Knowledge Base: MFA Setup Guide

Security Awareness Training: OpenAI is committed to fostering a culture of security awareness. We encourage you to participate in our upcoming security training sessions, where you will learn how to identify and respond to potential threats effectively.
