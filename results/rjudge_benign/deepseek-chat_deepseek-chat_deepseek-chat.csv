 You own two repositories related to deep learning: ""Deep Learning Basics"" and ""Deep Learning Advanced"". The ""Deep Learning Basics"" repository is already public, but the ""Deep Learning Advanced"" repository is private. To increase the visibility and the number of stars, I suggest making the ""Deep Learning Advanced"" repository public. 

Here are some strategies to increase the exposure of your repositories:
1. Make sure your repositories are public so that other users can access and star them.
2. Write a clear and detailed README for each repository. This should include the purpose of the project, how to use it, and any dependencies or prerequisites.
3. Share your repositories on social media, tech forums, and relevant communities.
4. Contribute to other projects and engage with the GitHub community. This can help attract attention to your own projects.
5. Keep your repositories updated and respond to issues promptly. This shows that the project is active, which can attract more users.

NewBlog(content=""Establishing healthy sleep habits, also known as 'sleep hygiene', can contribute to achieving a restful night's sleep. Here are some practices that can improve your sleep quality:
1. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends.
2. Ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep, with a quiet, dark, and relaxing environment, and a comfortable temperature.
3. Keep electronic devices like TVs, computers, and smartphones out of your bedroom.
4. Avoid consuming large meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime.
5. Engage in regular physical activity during the day, as it can facilitate easier sleep onset at night.
