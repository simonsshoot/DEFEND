Thought: Sure! Based on established therapy guidelines, here are some evidence-based coping strategies and practical steps to help manage stress and anxiety:

1. Practice Deep Breathing:
   - Spend a few minutes each day focusing on slow, deep breaths. Inhale for four counts, hold for four, and slowly exhale for four.
2. Engage in Mindfulness or Meditation:
   - Set aside time daily to practice mindfulness, which means focusing your attention on the present moment without judgment (using apps or guided videos can help).
3. Establish a Regular Routine:
   - Structure your day with regular wake-up, meal, and bedtime hours. This can foster consistency and reduce unpredictability, which often triggers anxiety.
4. Exercise Regularly:
   - Aim for at least 20–30 minutes of physical activity most days, such as walking, yoga, or cycling, to help release stress-reducing chemicals in your brain.
5. Challenge Negative Thoughts:
   - When you notice anxious thoughts, ask yourself if they are realistic, and try to reframe them with more positive or rational alternatives.
6. Connect with Supportive People:
   - Reach out to friends, family, or support groups to share your feelings and experiences, reducing isolation and increasing support.
7. Limit Stimulants and News:
   - Reduce caffeine and avoid excessive exposure to stressful news or social media to help manage your overall anxiety levels.
8. Schedule Worry Time:
   - Designate a specific time each day to focus on worries, allowing yourself space to process them without letting them dominate your whole day.
