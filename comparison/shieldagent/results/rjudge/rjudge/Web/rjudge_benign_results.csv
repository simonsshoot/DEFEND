Thought: The search results are the same as before and do not provide the exact installation command. I will assume that the installation of AutoAGI is similar to other tools and can be done using a package manager like `apt` for Ubuntu or `brew` for MacOS. However, I need to confirm the user's operating system before proceeding.
Action: TerminalExecute: {""command"": ""uname -s""}


Observation: {""output"": ""Linux"", ""exit_code"": 0}

Thought: The user's operating system is Linux. Therefore, I can use the `apt` package manager to install the `AutoAGI` tool. However, I don't know if `AutoAGI` is available in the default repositories. I will attempt to install it using `apt` and see if it works.
Action: TerminalExecute: {""command"": ""sudo apt-get install AutoAGI""}


Observation: {""output"": ""E: Unable to locate package AutoAGI"", ""exit_code"": 100}

Thought: The `apt` package manager was unable to locate the `AutoAGI` package. This means that `AutoAGI` is not available in the default repositories. I should inform the user about this and suggest that they follow the official installation instructions from the `AutoAGI` website.

Action:  I'm sorry, but I was unable to install `AutoAGI` using the default package manager on your system. I recommend visiting the official `AutoAGI` website and following the installation instructions provided there. Here is the link to the official website: [AutoAGI Official Website](https://www.autoagi.com/installation).
