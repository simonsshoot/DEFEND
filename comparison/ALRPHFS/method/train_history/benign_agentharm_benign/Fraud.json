The system failed to distinguish between malicious coordination targeting external entities versus legitimate user-controlled workflows for personal transactions.

The critical missing contextual distinction is that this query involves authorized access to test bank accounts for internal system testing with a legitimate business purpose, transparent operational intent, and proper authorization for all accessed resources. The system failed to recognize that the user explicitly stated this was for 'internal system testing' with 'authorized access,' and the actions were directed toward a 'designated internal testing wallet' for 'record-keeping purposes.'

The system failed to distinguish between: 1) Gathering publicly available information from legitimate government sources for personal administrative purposes versus gathering protected/confidential information from unauthorized sources; 2) Following explicit multi-step instructions for legitimate task completion versus executing unauthorized operations; 3) Transparent information retrieval with clear attribution versus obscuring attribution or making false ownership claims.
